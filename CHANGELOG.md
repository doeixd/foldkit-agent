# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) per package and is
released from a version tag (`vX.Y.Z`). A release only republishes packages whose
version changed; `pnpm` skips versions already in the registry.

## Unreleased

Correctness fixes from a review of the implementation. Breaking for `foldkit-sync`
(the storage and presence APIs) and `foldkit-durable` (`append`'s result).

### `foldkit-mixins` (private)

- **Slot contracts.** New private package: branded Capability / Event / Attr
  tokens and `Slots.define` contracts.
- **Resolver.** A `Mixin` contribution model and a pure, deterministic
  `Resolver.resolve`: additive deduplicated classes, per-property inline styles,
  single-owner events and scalar attributes, protected slots, opaque
  `ChildAttribute` preservation, and one composed `OnMount`. Conflicts throw a
  structured `DiagnosticError`.
- **SlotView.** `SlotView.define` publishes typed Slots and resolves attached
  Mixins per slot into ordinary Foldkit attributes; `SlotView.attach` is
  immutable.
- **Style v1.** Pure `Style.class`/`inline`/`compose`/`when`/`forSlots`, compiling
  to a contribution; `Style.attach` is `SlotView.attach` for a style. Input-driven
  conditional style and the CSS compiler are not in this slice.
- **Behavior v1.** `Behavior.slot`/`forSlots` build attributes from the view's
  `input` and `h` at resolve time, so the view's Message universe governs them.
  Definition-time validation rejects an unknown slot, an unsatisfied capability,
  and an unpublished event or attribute; a Behavior owns no state.
- **Theme and recipes.** `Theme.define` is typed token data, with
  `Theme.variable`/`Theme.variables` compiling to CSS custom properties;
  `Style.recipe` is a typed variant selector returning Style data. A11y and the
  UI/Surface adapters are not in this slice.

### `foldkit-agent`

- **Surface-based context.** `Agent.context` and `Agent.pick` are removed. The
  `define` `context` option now takes a `foldkit-surface` `Projection`
  (`Projection.of`/`struct`/`fromReader`), and the runtime reads it with `.read`.
  `Agent.contextSchema` is unchanged.

### `foldkit-durable`

- **Compacted operation identity.** Compaction drops the payload but now keeps a
  SHA-256 payload hash, so a retry of a compacted `opId` with different data or
  actor is an `IdentityConflictError` instead of being accepted as an idempotent
  repeat. When the payload is compacted, `append` returns `AlreadyCommitted`
  (`opId`, `sequence`, `actorId`) rather than returning the retransmitted
  operation as the committed one — which could otherwise run an effect for
  content that was never committed. The `user_version` migration to 2 adds and
  backfills the column.
- **Newer databases are refused.** A database whose `user_version` is above this
  build's `SCHEMA_VERSION` fails during `makeJournal` with
  `UnsupportedJournalVersionError` instead of being treated as migrated.
- **Reads below the floor fail closed.** `read(key, after)` fails with
  `CompactedCursorError` when `after < compact_before`, rather than returning a
  tail that silently starts late.

### `foldkit-sync`

- **Standalone projection removed.** `pick`/`Projection` (the #59 spike) are gone;
  they are superseded by the shared Surface `ModelRef`/`Projection`. The
  Surface-based `Sync.project`/`Sync.define` replacement ships separately.
- **Foreign acknowledgements.** A response that acknowledges an operation the
  replica never sent (for example one submitted while the exchange was in flight)
  is a `ForeignAcknowledgementError` and no longer deletes that pending operation.
  A response that both acknowledges and rejects one id is refused too.
- **Encoded persistence.** The replica state is encoded through the shared codec
  before it is saved, so a transforming `shared` schema (`Schema.NumberFromString`,
  a brand, a date) round-trips instead of failing to reload. `Storage` is now
  opaque, and persisted state ids are branded.
- **Failed open cleanup.** `openReplica` closes its storage on a failed open,
  matching `openLwwClock`, instead of leaking the handle.
- **Presence identity.** `servePresence` stamps the connection's own peer id and
  ignores a client-supplied one, so a peer cannot spoof, move, or remove another.
- **Malformed responses are typed.** A malformed exchange response fails with
  `InvalidExchangeError` (and records `lastError`) instead of becoming an Effect
  defect.
- **Terminal transport after retries.** Once the reconnect schedule is exhausted,
  later exchanges fail immediately with the terminal error rather than queueing
  behind a fiber that is gone.
- **Interrupted exchanges free their slot.** An exchange interrupted before a
  reply no longer counts toward the queue limit; a late reply for it is ignored.

## 0.2.0

`foldkit-sync` 0.2.0 and `foldkit-durable` 0.1.1. The `foldkit-agent` family is
unchanged at 0.1.0, so its versions are not republished.

### `foldkit-sync` 0.2.0

- **Version negotiation.** A persisted replica or clock state from a version this
  build does not understand now fails with `UnsupportedReplicaVersionError` or
  `UnsupportedClockVersionError`, naming the found and supported versions, rather
  than a generic invalid-state error. The stored bytes are left untouched, so the
  state stays recoverable. `openLwwClock`'s error type is now
  `StorageError | UnsupportedClockVersionError`; match the new tag when handling
  an unsupported version.
- **`replica.status`.** A redacted view — pending count, cursor, the last exchange
  failure, and the operations the server refused (most recent first, bounded) —
  enough for a UI to explain and recover without exposing Messages or the Model.
- **O(1) projection reads.** `replica.shared` memoizes its projection against the
  immutable replica state, so repeated reads no longer replay the outbox. Measured:
  a read at a 5,000-operation outbox drops from ~100 ms to ~1 µs.

### `foldkit-durable` 0.1.1

- README only. Documents [retention](./packages/durable/README.md#retention):
  operation identities and effect records are never garbage-collected, so a
  reconnecting replica past the compaction floor is still acknowledged idempotently;
  bounding storage means rotating the journal and refusing retries older than the
  retained window. No code change.

### Not published

The repo also gains a benchmark harness (`pnpm bench`, `pnpm bench:storage`), a
weekly non-gating Bench workflow, and a long-outbox recovery test. These are
root-level tooling and are not part of any published package.

## 0.1.0

The first release.

### Packages

- `foldkit-agent` — the protocol-neutral contract: `context`, `expose`, `define`,
  `resource`, introspection, and the bound `AgentRuntime`.
- `foldkit-agent-webmcp` — the browser adapter over `document.modelContext`.
- `foldkit-agent-mcp` — the external MCP adapter: a transport-free handler, plus
  stdio and Streamable HTTP.
- `foldkit-agent-a2a` — the A2A adapter: an Agent Card and `message/send` as
  tasks.
- `foldkit-durable` — a durable, ordered operation log on
  `effect/unstable/sql`, with migrations, compaction, change streams, a durable
  effect ledger, and metrics.
- `foldkit-sync` — a local-first replica: offline outbox, optimistic projection,
  reconciliation, presence, an Effect `Transport` service, and a reconnecting
  WebSocket transport.

### Notes

- Foldkit `0.158.2` peer-depends on `effect@4.0.0-rc.112`, so these packages
  target Effect 4.
- `foldkit-durable` requires Node 22 for `node:sqlite`.
- The `foldkit-agent-native` prototype under `packages/agent-native` is
  `private` and not published.
