# Agent working agreements

## Commit cadence

- **Commit often.** Prefer small, coherent commits over one large one. Commit as
  soon as a unit of work stands on its own (a module, a config, a test file).
- **After every commit, double check the code.** Re-read the diff that was just
  committed, re-run the relevant checks (`pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`,
  `pnpm build`), and fix what the check surfaces in a follow-up commit rather
  than letting it accumulate.

## Tests

- **Verify every test can actually fail.** After writing tests, mutate the code
  under test (invert a condition, drop a guard, return a constant) and confirm
  the relevant test goes red, then revert. A test that passes against broken
  code is worse than no test.
- Assert on real behaviour, not on restatements of the implementation. No
  assertions that hold vacuously (`expect(x).toBeDefined()` on a value that is
  always defined), no tests that only exercise a mock, and never weaken an
  assertion to make a test pass.
- If a test cannot be made to fail, delete it or replace it with one that can.
